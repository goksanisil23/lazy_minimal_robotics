# Hungarian Assignment Algorithm
Hungarian algorithm is used to solve *weighted bipartite* assignment problems. In other words, if we have `n x n` table where the entries represent the cost of doing a job, Hungarian algorithm solves for the optimal assignment between row & col elements of this table that minimizes the total cost.
